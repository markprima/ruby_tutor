#rails Structure :MVC (Model, Views and Controller)
yaitu pemisahan lapisan presentasi (apa yang dilihat oleh user aplikasi dengan back end/ developer
(MVC is separation of presentation layer (what the user of the app sees in the browser/mobile devise) and the bussiness logic or back end(invisible layer))

model = user - post - article - stock
view = home - new - friends - my_portofolio.html.erb (user pov)
controller = user_controller - posts_controller - article_controller - stocks_controller (developer/ back end pov)

#General flow of Rails application:
-> Request made at browser
-> Request received at router of rails application
-> Request routed to appropriate action in a controller
-> Controller#action either renders a view template or communicates with model
-> Model communicates with database
-> Model sends back information to controller
-> Controller renders view
